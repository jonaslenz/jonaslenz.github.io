## Description

Once your got some data to SoilPulse by [adding files](SoilPulse_Core.html) you can get a first view on your data.
Frictionless allows to validate your data (and will likely produce several errors :(), which is great, as we can solve those to make the data machine readable!
There are exhaustive descriptions on [frictionless validation](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/docs/guides/validating-data.html) and [solving validation errors]([https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/docs/guides/transforming-data.html](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/docs/basic-examples.html)), which you can refer to.
SoilPulse nevertheless gives you direct access to the most often used transformation steps to solve validation errors.
