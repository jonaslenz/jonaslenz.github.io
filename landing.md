We seek to facilitate interoperability and reusability of soil functional data.
Such data are essential to further the understanding of the complex and nonlinearly interacting land surface system -- and these data are highly diverse, because of scale and spatio-temporal dependency, model specific demands and a varitey of analytical procedures.
SoilPulse will integrate and extend current (meta)data standards.
We will develop tools to guide users and to enable machine-readable data structures with automated tests for interoperability and reusability.
